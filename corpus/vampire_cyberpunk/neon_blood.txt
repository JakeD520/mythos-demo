Neo-Tokyo 2087 pulsed with neon arteries carrying data-blood through fiber optic veins. The megacorporation towers pierced the acid rain clouds, their glass facades reflecting the perpetual twilight of the polluted sky. In the shadows between these monuments to capitalism, the undead adapted to the digital age.

Vampire clans had evolved beyond their ancient feudal structures, organizing themselves into competing tech houses. House Dracul controlled the biotech industry, their laboratories growing synthetic blood in vats lined with rare earth metals. The Countess Elizaveta, whose fangs were now enhanced with titanium and neural interfaces, could taste the genetic modifications in her prey's DNA.

The Nosferatu had embraced cybernetic modification, replacing their rotting flesh with chromed augmentations and carbon fiber muscle. Their leader, known only as The Ghost in the Machine, existed more in cyberspace than physical reality. His consciousness flowed through the corporate networks, feeding on data streams and digital fear instead of mortal blood.

Young vampires jacked into the Net through cranial ports, their enhanced reflexes making them perfect netrunners and corporate assassins. They haunted virtual reality nightclubs where human avatars came to dance with digital death, never knowing their dance partners were predators that could drain their life force through the neural link itself.
