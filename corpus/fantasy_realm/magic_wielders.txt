The Order of the Silver Circle stood as the last bastion against the forces of the Void. These paladins wielded holy light as both sword and shield, their very presence causing undead creatures to flee or crumble to ash. Sister Evangeline, the Radiant Dawn, could heal mortal wounds with a touch and her prayers could raise pillars of consecrated flame.

Dark sorcerers in the Shadowlands practiced necromancy and blood magic, commanding legions of skeletal warriors and spectral wraiths. The Lich Lord Malachar had achieved immortality by binding his soul to a phylactery hidden in the deepest crypt of his fortress. His spells could wither armies and turn day to night across entire kingdoms.

Between light and darkness, the Green Wizards maintained the balance of nature. They understood that all magic came from the World's Heart, the great crystal at the planet's core that pulsed with primordial energy. Master Sage Aldwin could call forth earthquakes and tsunamis, but also heal blighted lands and restore life to barren deserts.

The common folk told tales of these mighty beings around their hearth fires, not knowing that some among them carried dormant magical gifts. A baker's daughter might discover she could see through illusions, or a shepherd boy might find that wolves and bears obeyed his commands. Magic, like water, found its own level and flowed where it would.
