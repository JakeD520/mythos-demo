The Chrome Cathedral served as neutral ground where all vampire houses could meet without violence. Built into an abandoned server facility, its stained glass windows were actually holographic displays showing data flows across the global network. The Archbishop, a thousand-year-old vampire whose body was more machine than flesh, presided over digital communion services where the faithful uploaded their memories to share collective experiences.

Human blood farms operated in the basement levels of corporate housing blocks, their inhabitants kept docile with neural implants that fed them pleasant virtual realities. The victims believed they were living luxurious lives while their blood was slowly harvested through intravenous feeds disguised as life support systems. Quality control algorithms monitored nutritional content and stress hormones to maintain optimal flavor profiles.

Resistance movements emerged among the human populations, led by hunters who had learned to combine ancient vampire lore with cutting-edge technology. They wielded UV laser weapons and carried EMF crucifixes that could disrupt vampiric neural enhancements. Their leader, known as Van Helsing 2.0, was himself a cyborg whose wetware had been blessed by the last remaining priests.

The night markets of the Underground District never closed, their vendors selling everything from synthetic blood substitutes to black market soul files. Young vampires could purchase the memories and skills of ancient masters, downloading centuries of experience directly into their neural cortex. But such power came with a price - each download carried the risk of personality fragmentation and digital madness.
