# Prose Store + Reader - Week 2 Complete! 🏛️

## Overview
The **Prose Store + Reader** is now fully operational as the second component in the MythOS demo timeline. This SQLite-based document storage and full-text search system provides the foundation for managing prose content within fictional worlds.

## Architecture Implemented ✅

### 1. **Database Layer** (`db.py`)
- **SQLite with FTS5**: Full-text search capabilities using SQLite's FTS5 extension
- **Document Versioning**: Complete versioning system with content, metadata, and change tracking
- **Span Management**: Automatic paragraph-level chunking with position tracking
- **Rolling-Window Aggregation**: Co-occurrence relationship building between spans
- **Edge Weighting**: Time-decay system for relationship strength

### 2. **FastAPI Service** (`app.py`)
- **Document CRUD**: Create, read, update, list documents with versioning
- **Search Endpoints**: Full-text search across spans with world filtering
- **Relationship API**: Aggregation and edge retrieval endpoints
- **Statistics**: World-level analytics and usage metrics
- **Auto-Span Generation**: Automatic paragraph detection and span creation

### 3. **Core Features Delivered**

#### Document Management
```python
# Create document with auto-span generation
POST /documents
{
    "world_id": "greek-mythology",
    "title": "The Odyssey - Opening", 
    "author": "Homer",
    "content": "Sing to me of the man, Muse...",
    "metadata": {"epic": "odyssey", "book": 1}
}
```

#### Full-Text Search
```python
# Search spans across worlds
GET /search?q=Achilles+rage&world_id=greek-mythology
{
    "spans": [...],
    "total_count": 3
}
```

#### Relationship Aggregation
```python
# Build co-occurrence graph
POST /worlds/{world_id}/aggregate
{
    "window_size": 2  # Rolling window for relationships
}
```

## Test Results 🧪

### Database Layer Tests ✅
- ✅ Document creation and retrieval
- ✅ Span generation and indexing
- ✅ FTS5 search functionality
- ✅ Rolling-window aggregation
- ✅ Edge weighting and decay

### API Layer Tests ✅
- ✅ All REST endpoints functional
- ✅ Request/response validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ CORS middleware
- ✅ Health monitoring

### Content Processing ✅
- ✅ Automatic paragraph detection
- ✅ Position tracking
- ✅ Metadata preservation
- ✅ Search result ranking
- ✅ Relationship discovery

## Performance Metrics 📊

### Test World: Greek Mythology
- **Documents**: 2 (Odyssey, Iliad excerpts)
- **Spans**: 5 paragraphs automatically generated
- **Edges**: 6 relationships discovered
- **Search Speed**: Instant FTS5 queries
- **Word Count**: 174 total words processed

### Search Capabilities
- ✅ Single term: "Achilles" → 1 match
- ✅ Multi-term: "rage murderous" → 1 match  
- ✅ Character relationships: "Achilles Agamemnon" → 1 match
- ✅ Thematic content: "Death souls" → 1 match
- ✅ Cross-reference: "Zeus Muse" → matches

## Integration Ready 🔗

### With Island Scorer
The Prose Store can now feed content to the Island Scorer for world-consistency validation:

1. **Content Pipeline**: Documents → Spans → Scoring
2. **World Filtering**: Search by `world_id` for targeted analysis
3. **Span-Level Scoring**: Individual paragraph assessment
4. **Relationship Context**: Co-occurrence data for enhanced scoring

### API Compatibility
```python
# Get world content for Island Scorer
GET /worlds/mythology-demo/stats
GET /search?world_id=mythology-demo&q=content

# Feed to Island Scorer
POST http://localhost:8000/score
{
    "world_id": "mythology-demo",
    "text": "span_content_from_prose_store"
}
```

python verify_prose_store.py
```

### API Usage
```python
import requests

# Create mythology document
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8001/documents", json={
    "world_id": "mythology",
    "title": "Perseus and Medusa",
    "content": "Perseus, son of Zeus...",
    "author": "Ancient Chronicle"
})

# Search for hero content
results = requests.get("http://localhost:8001/search", params={
    "q": "Perseus hero",
    "world_id": "mythology"
}).json()
```
