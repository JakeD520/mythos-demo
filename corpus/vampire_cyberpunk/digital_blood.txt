The Corporate Wars of 2085 had been fought in boardrooms and server farms as much as in the streets. When the dust settled, three vampire houses controlled the world's information infrastructure. Clan Ventrue owned the banking algorithms, every cryptocurrency transaction feeding their digital hunger for dominance. Their blood banks were now server farms, preserving not just plasma but also the neural patterns of their victims.

Street-level vampires prowled the underground districts where hackers and black market cyborgs gathered. These digital parasites could drain battery power from cybernetic implants, leaving their victims paralyzed and helpless. The most skilled could even feed through wifi signals, drawing electromagnetic energy from smart devices and IoT networks.

Dr. Sarah Chen, once human, now enhanced with Dracul biotech, ran an underground clinic for vampires seeking the latest upgrades. Her surgical suite combined ancient blood rituals with nano-surgery, implanting memory chips that contained centuries of vampire knowledge. Some clients chose aesthetic mods - programmable fangs that could inject custom toxins, or eyes that could see across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

The old rules still applied in this neon-lit world: vampires couldn't cross running water, though underground mag-lev trains proved an effective substitute for rivers. Mirrors still revealed their nature, but now that meant avoiding retinal scanners and facial recognition software. Wooden stakes were obsolete; depleted uranium rounds and EMP grenades were the weapons of modern vampire hunters.
