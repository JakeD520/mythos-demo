Book IX

Tell me, Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Zeus, from whatsoever point you may choose to begin.

Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called my men together and said, "My friends, we have meat and drink in the ship, let us not touch the cattle or we shall suffer for it; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun-god, who sees and gives ear to everything." And my men promised me solemnly that they would obey.

But Odysseus had bound himself to the mast, and his men stopped their ears with wax, so that he alone heard the Sirens' song. The Sirens sang sweetly, promising knowledge of all things, but Odysseus resisted their call and sailed safely past.

When they reached the land of the Cyclopes, Odysseus and his men entered the cave of Polyphemus. The giant Cyclops trapped them inside and began devouring the sailors two by two. Odysseus devised a clever plan: he gave the Cyclops strong wine until Polyphemus fell into a drunken stupor, then blinded him with a sharpened stake.

The golden-throned Dawn came early, and rosy-fingered Eos spread her light across the wine-dark sea. The ships of the Achaeans cut through the waves like dolphins, their bronze prows gleaming in the morning sun.

In the halls of Olympus, Zeus the Thunderer held council with the immortal gods. Athena, bright-eyed daughter of Zeus, spoke wisdom, while Poseidon the Earth-Shaker voiced his anger against the hero who had blinded his son.

The lotus-eaters welcomed the sailors with their honeyed fruit, which brought forgetfulness of home and duty. Some of Odysseus's men tasted the lotus and no longer wished to return to Ithaca, but Odysseus forced them back to the ships by strength.

Circe the witch-goddess transformed men into swine with her potions, but Odysseus, protected by the herb moly given by Hermes, resisted her magic and compelled her to restore his companions to human form.

In the underworld, Odysseus spoke with the shade of his mother Anticleia and the spirit of Achilles, who told him that it was better to be a living slave than a dead king. The prophet Tiresias warned him of the trials yet to come on his journey home to Ithaca.
