The Dragon Kings once ruled from their mountain fortresses, vast citadels carved into the peaks of the Dragonspine Mountains. Each dragon possessed a hoard not just of gold and gems, but of ancient knowledge and magical artifacts collected over millennia. The great wyrm Pyrothane the Crimson kept the Flame Eternal burning in his lair, a fire that had never been extinguished since the world's creation.

Dwarven clans delved deep into the mountain's heart, their forges ringing with the sound of hammers upon mithril and adamantine. Master smiths could fold starlight into steel and craft weapons that sang with their own inner light. The greatest of their works was the Hammer of Kings, which could level mountains or heal the deepest wounds depending on the wielder's heart.

Below even the dwarf-roads lay the Underdark, a realm of purple-glowing crystals and underground seas. Dark elves rode giant spiders through caverns vast as cathedral naves, their cities hanging from stalactites like jeweled chandeliers. Mind flayers and beholders contested for dominion over the deepest reaches, where the boundaries between reality and nightmare grew thin.

The surface kingdoms knew little of these depths, but they had their own wonders. Wizards in their towers studied the movements of celestial bodies, reading fate in the stars and commanding elemental forces. Knights rode forth on quests for the Holy Grail, their armor blessed by priests and their swords forged in dragon-fire.
