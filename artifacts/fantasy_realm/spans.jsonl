Each dragon possessed a hoard not just of gold and gems, but of ancient knowledge and magical artifacts collected over millennia. The great wyrm Pyrothane the Crimson kept the Flame Eternal burning in his lair, a fire that had never been extinguished since the world's creation. Dwarven clans delved deep into the mountain's heart, their forges ringing with the sound of hammers upon mithril and adamantine.

The greatest of their works was the Hammer of Kings, which could level mountains or heal the deepest wounds depending on the wielder's heart. Below even the dwarf-roads lay the Underdark, a realm of purple-glowing crystals and underground seas. Dark elves rode giant spiders through caverns vast as cathedral naves, their cities hanging from stalactites like jeweled chandeliers. Mind flayers and beholders contested for dominion over the deepest reaches, where the boundaries between reality and nightmare grew thin."}

The surface kingdoms knew little of these depths, but they had their own wonders. Wizards in their towers studied the movements of celestial bodies, reading fate in the stars and commanding elemental forces. Knights rode forth on quests for the Holy Grail, their armor blessed by priests and their swords forged in dragon-fire."}

Massive oak and ash trees towered hundreds of feet above, their canopies so thick that sunlight filtered through in golden beams, creating a cathedral of nature. Deep within these woods, the Silverleaf Elves had built their city of Luminspire among the branches. Elegant bridges of woven moonbeam and starlight connected tree-palaces, while crystalline fountains sang with the music of ages. The Elven Lord Thalasson ruled from his throne carved from a single piece of living amber, his crown wrought from silver branches"}

Magic flowed through the forest like morning mist. Unicorns grazed in clearings where flowers bloomed in colors that had no names, and their horns could purify the most poisoned water. Ancient wardstones hummed with protective enchantments, keeping the darkness of the Shadowlands at bay. Each stone was inscribed with runes that glowed soft blue under the moon, written in the Old Tongue by the first wizards. The druids of the Sacred Grove tended"}

The druids of the Sacred Grove tended to the World Tree, whose roots extended to the very heart of the earth and whose branches touched the realm of stars. They could speak with all creatures of the forest and knew the true names of every plant and stone. When great evil threatened the land, they would call upon the spirits of wind and storm to defend the natural order."}

These paladins wielded holy light as both sword and shield, their very presence causing undead creatures to flee or crumble to ash. Sister Evangeline, the Radiant Dawn, could heal mortal wounds with a touch and her prayers could raise pillars of consecrated flame. Dark sorcerers in the Shadowlands practiced necromancy and blood magic, commanding legions of skeletal warriors and spectral wraiths. The Lich Lord Malachar had achieved immortality by binding his soul to a phylactery hidden in the deepest crypt of his fortress."}

His spells could wither armies and turn day to night across entire kingdoms. Between light and darkness, the Green Wizards maintained the balance of nature. They understood that all magic came from the World's Heart, the great crystal at the planet's core that pulsed with primordial energy. Master Sage Aldwin could call forth earthquakes and tsunamis, but also heal blighted lands and restore life to barren deserts. The common folk told tales of these mighty beings around their hearth fires,"}

A baker's daughter might discover she could see through illusions, or a shepherd boy might find that wolves and bears obeyed his commands. Magic, like water, found its own level and flowed where it would."}
