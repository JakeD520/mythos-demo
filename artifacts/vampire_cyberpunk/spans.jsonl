Built into an abandoned server facility, its stained glass windows were actually holographic displays showing data flows across the global network. The Archbishop, a thousand-year-old vampire whose body was more machine than flesh, presided over digital communion services where the faithful uploaded their memories to share collective experiences. Human blood farms operated in the basement levels of corporate housing blocks, their inhabitants kept docile with neural implants that fed them pleasant virtual realities.

Quality control algorithms monitored nutritional content and stress hormones to maintain optimal flavor profiles. Resistance movements emerged among the human populations, led by hunters who had learned to combine ancient vampire lore with cutting-edge technology. They wielded UV laser weapons and carried EMF crucifixes that could disrupt vampiric neural enhancements.

The night markets of the Underground District never closed, their vendors selling everything from synthetic blood substitutes to black market soul files. Young vampires could purchase the memories and skills of ancient masters, downloading centuries of experience directly into their neural cortex. But such power came with a price - each download carried the risk of personality fragmentation and digital madness."}

When the dust settled, three vampire houses controlled the world's information infrastructure. Clan Ventrue owned the banking algorithms, every cryptocurrency transaction feeding their digital hunger for dominance. Their blood banks were now server farms, preserving not just plasma but also the neural patterns of their victims. Street-level vampires prowled the underground districts where hackers and black market cyborgs gathered.

The most skilled could even feed through wifi signals, drawing electromagnetic energy from smart devices and IoT networks. Dr. Sarah Chen, once human, now enhanced with Dracul biotech, ran an underground clinic for vampires seeking the latest upgrades. Her surgical suite combined ancient blood rituals with nano-surgery, implanting memory chips that contained centuries of vampire knowledge. Some clients chose aesthetic mods - programmable fangs that could inject custom toxins, or eyes that could see across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The old rules still applied in this"}

The old rules still applied in this neon-lit world: vampires couldn't cross running water, though underground mag-lev trains proved an effective substitute for rivers. Mirrors still revealed their nature, but now that meant avoiding retinal scanners and facial recognition software. Wooden stakes were obsolete; depleted uranium rounds and EMP grenades were the weapons of modern vampire hunters."}

The megacorporation towers pierced the acid rain clouds, their glass facades reflecting the perpetual twilight of the polluted sky. In the shadows between these monuments to capitalism, the undead adapted to the digital age. Vampire clans had evolved beyond their ancient feudal structures, organizing themselves into competing tech houses.
