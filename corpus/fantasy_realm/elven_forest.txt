The Eternal Forest stretched beyond mortal comprehension, its ancient trees whispering secrets in languages older than elvish tongues. Massive oak and ash trees towered hundreds of feet above, their canopies so thick that sunlight filtered through in golden beams, creating a cathedral of nature.

Deep within these woods, the Silverleaf Elves had built their city of Luminspire among the branches. Elegant bridges of woven moonbeam and starlight connected tree-palaces, while crystalline fountains sang with the music of ages. The Elven Lord Thalasson ruled from his throne carved from a single piece of living amber, his crown wrought from silver branches that still bore leaves of pure light.

Magic flowed through the forest like morning mist. Unicorns grazed in clearings where flowers bloomed in colors that had no names, and their horns could purify the most poisoned water. Ancient wardstones hummed with protective enchantments, keeping the darkness of the Shadowlands at bay. Each stone was inscribed with runes that glowed soft blue under the moon, written in the Old Tongue by the first wizards.

The druids of the Sacred Grove tended to the World Tree, whose roots extended to the very heart of the earth and whose branches touched the realm of stars. They could speak with all creatures of the forest and knew the true names of every plant and stone. When great evil threatened the land, they would call upon the spirits of wind and storm to defend the natural order.
